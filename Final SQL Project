# For this project I utilised the chinook database (https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) using SQLite Studio.
# I connected the database and then performed analytics on it.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT
    FirstName || " " || LastName,
    CustomerId,
    Country
FROM
    chinook.customers
WHERE
    Country <> "USA"
;

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT
    *
FROM
    chinook.customers
WHERE
    Country = "Brazil"
;

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT
    c.FirstName || " " || c.LastName AS FullName,
    i.InvoiceId,
    i.InvoiceDate,
    i.BillingCountry
FROM
    chinook.invoices i
INNER JOIN
    chinook.customers c
ON
    i.CustomerId  = c.CustomerId
WHERE
    Country = "Brazil"
;

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT
    *
FROM
    chinook.employees
WHERE
    Title = "Sales Support Agent"
;

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT
    DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM
    chinook.invoices
;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT
    e.FirstName || " " || e.LastName AS SalesAgentFullName,
    i.InvoiceId
FROM
    chinook.employees e
JOIN
    chinook.customers c
ON
    e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN
    chinook.invoices i
ON
    i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT
    c.FirstName || " " || c.LastName AS CustomerFullName,
    c.Country,
    e.FirstName || " " || e.LastName AS SalesAgentFullName,
    i.Total
FROM
    chinook.customers c
JOIN
    chinook.employees e
ON
    c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN
    chinook.invoices i
ON
    i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS TotalInvoices
FROM
    chinook.invoices
WHERE
    InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
;

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT
    ROUND(SUM(Total),2) AS TotalSales
FROM
    chinook.invoices
WHERE
    InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
;

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT
    t.Name AS PurchasedTrackName,
    it.InvoiceLineId
FROM
    chinook.invoice_items it
JOIN
    chinook.tracks t
ON
    it.TrackId = t.TrackId
;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT
    t.Name AS PurchasedTrackName,
    art.Name AS ArtistName,
    it.InvoiceLineId
FROM
    chinook.invoice_items it
LEFT JOIN
    chinook.tracks t
ON
    it.TrackId = t.TrackId
INNER JOIN
    chinook.albums alb

    t.GenreId = g.GenreId
;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT
    e.FirstName || " " || e.LastName AS SalesAgentFullName,
    ROUND(SUM(i.Total),2) AS TotalSales

JOIN
    chinook.customers c
ON
    e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN
    chinook.invoices i
ON
    c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE
    e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY
    SalesAgentFullName

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009? 

SELECT

JOIN
    chinook.customers c
ON
    e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
JOIN
    chinook.invoices i
ON
    c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE
    e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND
    i.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY
    SalesAgentFullName
ORDER BY
    TotalSales DESC LIMIT 1
;

#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#Preliminary Stage: Cleaning data. Before querying this database, I need to verify that the data contained within is ready to be anaylsed. If it requires cleaning
#I will be taking appropriate steps to do so before commencing my project. I will first query the 'customers' table below:

SELECT
  *
FROM
  BIT_DB.customers

#Running this query, and then sorting by column 'order_id' reveals that there are multiple rows that contain invalid entries (that is, more characters than a standard order_id).
#Therefore, it is now necessary to filter out these invalid results out of any further queries, using the following addition to my queries:

WHERE 
  length(order_id) = 6
AND
  order_id <> 'Order ID'

#Having reviewed the schema of the database, it has become clear that the order data tables contain a slight variation of the 'order_id' column that is found in the 'customers' table.
#An amended addition, shown below, must be added to the queries for these tables including the 'order_id' column:

WHERE 
  length(orderID) = 6
AND
  orderID <> 'Order ID'

#With the data sufficiently filtered, I can now begin to query the database.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT
    count(orderID)
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE 
  length(orderID) = 6
AND
  orderID <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT
    count(orderID)
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE
    Product = 'iPhone'
AND
  length(orderID) = 6
AND
  orderID <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT
    acctnum
FROM
    BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN
    BIT_DB.FebSales fs
ON
    c.order_id = fs.orderID
WHERE 
  length(orderID) = 6
AND
  orderID <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT
    DISTINCT Product,
    price
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE
    price in (
        SELECT
            min(price)
        FROM
            BIT_DB.JanSales
        )
AND
  length(orderID) = 6
AND
  orderID <> 'Order ID'

#OR

SELECT
    DISTINCT Product,
    price
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE
  length(orderID) = 6
AND
  orderID <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY
    price ASC
LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT
    SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue,
    Product
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE
  length(orderID) = 6
AND
  orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY
    Product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT
    Product,
    Quantity,
    SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM
    BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE
    location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND
  length(orderID) = 6
AND
  orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY
    Product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum) AS multiple_order_customers,
    AVG(Quantity*price) AS average_spend
FROM
    BIT_DB.FebSales fs
LEFT JOIN
    BIT_DB.customers c
ON
    fs.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE
    fs.Quantity > 2
AND
  length(orderID) = 6
AND
  orderID <> 'Order ID'

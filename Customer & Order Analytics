#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#Preliminary Stage: Cleaning data. Before querying this database, I need to verify that the data contained within is ready to be anaylsed. If it requires cleaning
#I will be taking appropriate steps to do so before commencing my project. I will first query the 'customers' table below:

SELECT
  *
FROM
  BIT_DB.customers

#Running this query, and then sorting by column 'order_id' reveals that there are multiple rows that contain invalid entries (that is, more characters than a standard order_id).
#Therefore, it is now necessary to filter out these invalid results out of any further queries, using the following addition to my queries:

WHERE 
  length(order_id) = 6
AND
  order_id <> 'Order ID'

#Having reviewed the schema of the database, it has become clear that the order data tables contain a slight variation of the 'order_id' column that is found in the 'customers' table.
#An amended addition, shown below, must be added to the queries for these tables including the 'order_id' column:

WHERE 
  length(orderID) = 6
AND
  orderID <> 'Order ID'

#With the data sufficiently filtered, I can now begin to query the database.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT
    count(orderID)
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE 
  length(orderID) = 6

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT

  orderID <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

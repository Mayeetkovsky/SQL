#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle (link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021?select=spotify_top50_2021.csv)
#Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
#Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE
    BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
        id integer PRIMARY KEY,
        artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
        track_name varchar NOT NULL,
        track_id varchar NOT NULL,
        popularity integer NOT NULL,
        danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
        energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
        song_key integer NOT NULL,
        loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
        song_mode integer NOT NULL,
        speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
        acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
        instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
        liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
        valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
        tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
        duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
        time_signature integer NOT NULL
        )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.

SELECT
    artist_name,
    track_name,
    AVG(popularity),
    AVG(danceability),
    AVG(energy)
FROM
    BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY
    artist_name,
    track_name

#Then I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity.

SELECT
    track_name,
    artist_name,
    popularity
FROM
    BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY
    popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

#Next, I found which artist released the longest song.

SELECT
    track_name,
    artist_name,
    duration_ms
FROM
    BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY
    duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1

#Now, Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table.
#Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH avgpopCTE AS
    (SELECT
        s.artist_name,
        AVG(s.popularity) as avg_pop
    FROM
        Spotifydata s
    GROUP BY
        s.artist_name
    )
    
SELECT
    artist_name,
    avg_pop,
    'TOP STAR' AS tag
FROM
    avgpopCTE
WHERE
    avg_pop>=90
    ;
